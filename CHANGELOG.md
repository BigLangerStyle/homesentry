and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

**Recent Alerts — Append-Only Event Log**
- **Root cause:** `events` table had a `UNIQUE` constraint on `event_key` and used `INSERT OR REPLACE`, meaning each monitored item kept only one row — its current state. On a healthy system, Recent Alerts showed only recovery events (WARN→OK, FAIL→OK) because degradation events were silently overwritten when the service recovered.
- **Schema migration (v1.0.0):** Recreated `events` table without the `UNIQUE` constraint on `event_key` via the standard SQLite table-recreation pattern (create `events_new` → copy rows → drop old → rename). Existing data is preserved. Indexes recreated identically.
- **`insert_event()` in `db.py`:** Changed `INSERT OR REPLACE` to plain `INSERT` — every state change now appends a new row.
- **No changes to state-tracking logic:** `get_latest_event_by_key()` already uses `ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 1` and continues to return the correct current state. `get_latest_events()` already orders by `ts DESC` and now returns full history across all keys. `update_event_notified()` already targets `MAX(ts)` per key and is unaffected.
- **Result:** Recent Alerts now shows a genuine history of state changes — both degradation (OK→FAIL) and recovery (FAIL→OK) events are visible, in chronological order.



### Changed

**db.py Code Quality Cleanup**
- **Parameterized SQL in `delete_old_metrics()`** — replaced f-string SQL interpolation with a parameterized query using SQLite's `datetime('now', '-' || ? || ' days')` form; applies to both the `metrics_samples` DELETE and the `service_status` DELETE; eliminates a non-idiomatic pattern even though `retention_days` is always an integer
- **Specific exception type in `get_sleep_events()`** — replaced bare `except:` with `except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError):` to avoid swallowing unrelated exceptions during JSON parsing of `details_json\`

**Version Bump**
- Bumped version string to `0.9.0` in `app/main.py` (FastAPI constructor and startup log line)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

**Dashboard UX Improvements**
- **"Last refreshed" indicator** — displays `Last refreshed: HH:MM:SS AM/PM TZ` in the dashboard header, updated each time the JavaScript polling cycle completes; uses 12-hour AM/PM format with timezone abbreviation (e.g., "2:47:03 PM CST")
- **Chart empty-state handling** — when a metric returns no data for the selected time range, the chart container now shows a friendly "No data yet — check back after the next collection cycle" message instead of a blank canvas; implemented by checking `data.count === 0` before calling `new Chart()`
- **Disk-free chart y-axis padding** — disk-free charts (metrics containing "disk", "free", "GB") now apply 10% padding below the minimum data value to prevent dramatic-looking charts from small absolute changes on large volumes; percentage charts (CPU %, RAM %) remain locked to 0–100 range
- **Disk-free chart minimum y-axis range** — replaces the 10% padding approach; disk-free charts now enforce a minimum axis span of `max(10 GB, 5% of max value)`, centered around the data midpoint; prevents a 0.1 GB change on a 45 GB volume from filling the entire chart height, while a 3 GB change on a 2,057 GB array is shown in a ~103 GB context; percentage charts unaffected

**Data Retention — Nightly metrics_samples Cleanup**
- **New `delete_old_metrics(retention_days)` function** in `app/storage/db.py` — deletes rows from `metrics_samples` and `service_status` older than the configured retention window; returns a tuple of deleted row counts; the `events` table is intentionally left untouched
- **New `run_nightly_cleanup()` async function** in `app/scheduler.py` — reads `METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS` from environment, calls `delete_old_metrics()`, logs deleted counts at INFO level; logs a WARNING and skips cleanup if retention is set to 0 (disabled)
- **Nightly cleanup wired into main scheduler loop** — fires once per day at 3:00 AM using a `_last_cleanup_date` date tracker (same pattern as the morning summary deduplication); does not run on every cycle
- **New `METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable** (default: `30`) — controls how many days of historical metrics to retain; set to `0` to disable cleanup entirely



### Added

**Historical Data Charts**
- **New API endpoint** `GET /api/metrics/history/available` — dynamically discovers chartable metrics that have data in the database, returning labels and units for each
- **New API endpoint** `GET /api/metrics/history?metric=&hours=` — returns bucketed time-series JSON ready for Chart.js; auto-scales to 36/60/84 data points for 6h/24h/7d ranges respectively
- **New `get_metric_history()` function** in `app/storage/db.py` — SQLite time bucketing using strftime for efficient aggregation across arbitrary time ranges
- **New `get_available_chart_metrics()` function** in `app/storage/db.py` — queries distinct metric names from `metrics_samples` to dynamically build the available metrics list
- **"Historical Trends" dashboard section** — appears below Infrastructure Layer with a 2-column chart grid
- **Chart.js 4.4.1 via CDN** — no new Python dependencies required
- **Default charts**: CPU %, RAM %, and disk free GB for all mounted paths with data (e.g., `/host`, `/mnt/Array`)
- **Time range selector**: 6h / 24h / 7d buttons — refreshes all charts simultaneously on click
- **Dark mode support**: Chart grid lines, tick labels, and legends update automatically on theme toggle via CSS variables
- **Chart container CSS** added to `styles.css` with full dark mode CSS variable support

**Implementation notes:**
- Metric names use underscores matching actual database values (e.g., `memory_percent`, `disk_mnt_Array_free_gb`)
- Bucketing resolution scales with time range to keep chart density consistent



### Added

**Sustained State Checking with Grace Period**
- **Grace period tracking**: New `app/alerts/grace_period.py` module implements sustained state checking to prevent alerts on transient flaps
- **Configurable threshold**: `STATE_CHANGE_GRACE_CHECKS=3` env variable controls how many consecutive bad checks are required before alerting
- **Intelligent suppression**: Brief service hiccups (e.g., OK→FAIL→OK within 1-2 checks) are completely ignored and don't create events
- **Immediate recovery alerts**: Recovery to OK status always alerts immediately (no grace period for good news)
- **In-memory tracking**: Pending state changes tracked in memory, only logged to database after grace period threshold is met
- **Comprehensive logging**: Grace period decisions logged at INFO level for troubleshooting

**Example behavior:**
- Service flaps (1-2 checks): No alert, no database event, completely silent
- Sustained failure (3+ consecutive checks): Alert proceeds normally after threshold
- Recovery during grace period: Pending state discarded, no alert sent
- Recovery after alerting: Immediate recovery notification sent

### Fixed

**Morning Summary Timestamp Display**
- **Activity Log timestamps**: Changed format from 24-hour (`05:01`) to 12-hour with AM/PM (`5:01 AM`) for clarity
- **Timezone conversion**: Fixed UTC-to-local timezone conversion — timestamps now display in server's local time instead of UTC
- **Example**: Router reboot at 5:01 AM CST now correctly displays as `5:01 AM` instead of `11:01 AM` (UTC)
- **No logic changes**: Only affects display formatting in Discord morning summary — event collection and storage remain unchanged

**Duplicate Morning Summary**
- **Added last-sent tracker**: Module-level `_last_summary_sent` variable in `scheduler.py` prevents duplicate morning summaries
- **5-minute window**: Skips summary if already sent within last 5 minutes
- **Fixes issue**: Eliminated duplicate summaries at 5:59 AM and 6:00 AM when scheduler runs on both sides of the wake time boundary

**Maintenance Window Filtering in Morning Summaries**
- **Sleep + maintenance conflict**: Events occurring during maintenance windows (e.g., 5:00-5:15 AM router reboot) are now properly excluded from morning summaries
- **Architectural fix**: Morning summary generation now calls `should_suppress_alert()` with event timestamps to check maintenance windows
- **Previous behavior**: During sleep hours, ALL events were queued regardless of maintenance windows — router reboots generated 12+ events in morning summary
- **New behavior**: Events during maintenance windows are filtered out and counted separately — "Quiet Night" summary when only maintenance events occurred
- **Visibility**: Summary shows count of excluded maintenance events (e.g., "• 12 maintenance events excluded")
- **Audit trail preserved**: Maintenance events still logged to database, just excluded from Discord summary display

### Security
- **Removed .env from Git tracking** - The `.env` file containing sensitive configuration (Discord webhooks, API keys, service credentials) is no longer tracked in version control
  - Purged `.env` from entire Git history using BFG Repo-Cleaner (all 159 commits cleaned)
  - Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent future commits of sensitive data
  - `.env.example` remains in repository as a template for new installations
  - Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
  - Existing installations: Local `.env` files are preserved and remain functional
  - New installations: Users should copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure with their credentials

### Documentation
- Updated `.env.example` with detailed explanation of `STATE_CHANGE_GRACE_CHECKS` including examples
- Added comprehensive docstrings to `grace_period.py` explaining the sustained state checking pattern
- Updated module docstring in `check_morning_summary()` to document duplicate prevention logic

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Sleep schedule configuration**: Sleep schedule was disabled in `.env` - changed `SLEEP_SCHEDULE_ENABLED=false` to `true` to activate the feature
- **Sleep schedule boundary condition**: Fixed end time comparison to use exclusive boundary (`<` instead of `<=`), ensuring alerts resume exactly at configured wake time rather than one minute after
  - Sleep period is now `[start_time, end_time)` (half-open interval) matching standard time range conventions
  - Morning summaries now send on schedule instead of being suppressed at their configured time
  - Alert resumption happens immediately at wake time (e.g., 6:00 AM) instead of being delayed to 6:01 AM
- **Wake time adjusted**: Changed `SLEEP_SCHEDULE_END` from 07:30 to 06:00 in `.env` to match user's intended midnight-6AM sleep schedule

### Documentation
- Updated `.env.example` sleep schedule section to clarify that END time is exclusive (alerts resume AT this time, not after)
- Changed default wake time examples from 07:30 to 06:00 for consistency with common sleep schedules
- Added inline comment explaining START is inclusive, END is exclusive

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- Fixed version string in `scheduler.py` startup log from v0.2.0 to v0.3.0
- Corrected version string in `main.py` application metadata from v0.2.0 to v0.3.0

**Configuration**
- Stripped CRLF corruption from `.env.example` (lines had 5–6 stray `\r` characters)
- Removed duplicate `SMART_POLL_INTERVAL` entry from `.env.example` SMART section (canonical entry retained in Polling Intervals)
- Removed stale "future feature" comment on `SMART_POLL_INTERVAL` — SMART monitoring shipped in v0.2.0
- Removed ghost `TAUTULLI_URL` entry and `TAUTULLI_MAINTENANCE_WINDOW` comment from `.env.example` — no Tautulli module exists
- Fixed Pi-hole notes in `.env.example`: removed v5 fallback references, module targets Pi-hole v6 session-based auth only
- Added missing `RAID_POLL_INTERVAL` to Polling Intervals section of `.env.example` (default: 300, matching RAID collector)
- Updated `RAID_POLL_INTERVAL` default from 120 to 300 in RAID section to match collector's actual poll interval

**File Organization** *(flagged for manual action — not applied in this commit)*
- Stray `gitignore` file (no dot prefix) at repo root should be deleted — `.gitignore` already exists
- `test_database.py` at repo root should be moved to `tests/`
