description: Create a feature branch for new work
---
1. Analyze the current task to generate a relevant, short branch name using standard prefixes (e.g., `feature/add-login`, `fix/shortcut-bug`, `docs/update-readme`, `chore/bump-deps`, `refactor/api-client`).
2. Propose this branch name to the user and ask for confirmation or an alternative.
3. // turbo
4. Once confirmed, run `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create and switch to the new branch.
5. Confirm to the user that we are now on the new branch.
